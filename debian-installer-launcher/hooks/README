Debian-installer-launcher hooks
-------------------------------

You can put script files in this directory and they will be called by
various hooks of debian-installer-launcher. The hook name is given as
first parameter when the script is executed.

Existing hooks:
- startup: called right at the start, even before the "prepare" step of
  the plugin used.
- cleanup: called at the very end, once all plugins have cleaned up. Those
  hooks are executed in reverse order.
