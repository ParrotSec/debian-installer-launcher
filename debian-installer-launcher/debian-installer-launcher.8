.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a desktop launcher for Debian Installer images. It is intended to be used on Debian Live systems.
.PP
You probably do not want to install this package onto a non-live system, although it will do no harm.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fBPLUGIN\fR" 4
specifies which plugin should be used. Currently only the 'live' plugin is available.

.SH LIVE PLUGIN OPTIONS
.IP "\-e, \-\-expert" 4
the live plugin defaults to use standard priority. With this option, the installer priority can be set to low which is commonly known as the 'expert mode' of the installer.
.IP "\-t, \-\-text" 4
the live plugin defaults to use the GTK+ installer frontend, if available/possible. With this option, the text frontend can be enforced. If used in a GUI, a terminal-emulator will be opened to show the text installer.
